      "text": "60 minutes rewind seven years ago steve jobs asked walter&nbsp; isaacson a former editor of time magazine&nbsp;&nbsp; if he would write his biography isaacson who&nbsp; has done books about benjamin franklin and&nbsp;&nbsp; albert einstein thought the request presumptuous&nbsp; and premature since jobs was still a young man&nbsp;&nbsp; what isaacson didn't know at the time and only a&nbsp; few people did was that jobs was about to undergo&nbsp;&nbsp; surgery for pancreatic cancer and was feeling&nbsp; his mortality it speaks to the secrecy with&nbsp;&nbsp; which jobs conducted his life and his business&nbsp; adding mystery to an already compelling figure&nbsp;&nbsp; in 2009 with jobs already gravely ill isaacson&nbsp; began the first of more than 40 interviews with&nbsp;&nbsp; him the last was conducted a few weeks before his&nbsp; death some of them were tape recorded and you will&nbsp;&nbsp; hear parts of them tonight i have no skeletons&nbsp; in my closet that can't be allowed out job said&nbsp;&nbsp; and like a well-timed apple launch the book titled&nbsp; simply steve jobs will be in stores tomorrow just&nbsp;&nbsp; two and a half weeks after he died when walter&nbsp; isaacson first began working on the book which&nbsp;&nbsp; is published by simon schuster a division of&nbsp; cbs steve jobs wife laureen powell told him&nbsp;&nbsp; be honest with his failings as well as his&nbsp; strengths there are parts of his life and his&nbsp;&nbsp; personality that are extremely messy you shouldn't&nbsp; whitewash it i'd like to see that it's all told&nbsp;&nbsp; truthfully he's not warm and fuzzy you know and&nbsp; to do it isaacson interviewed more than a hundred&nbsp;&nbsp; people jobs as friends family co-workers&nbsp; and competitors i think it's a tough book&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a book that's fair i mean this is a real&nbsp; human being he had lots of flaws he was very&nbsp;&nbsp; petulant he was very brittle he could be very&nbsp; very mean to people at times and whether it was&nbsp;&nbsp; to a waitress in a restaurant or to a guy who&nbsp; had stayed up all night coding he could just&nbsp;&nbsp; really just go at them and say you're doing this&nbsp; all wrong it's horrible and you'd say why did you&nbsp;&nbsp; do that why want you nicer and he'd say i really&nbsp; want to be with people who demand perfection and&nbsp;&nbsp; this is who i am isaacson believes that much of&nbsp; it can be traced to the earliest years of his life&nbsp;&nbsp; and to the fact that jobs was born out of&nbsp; wedlock given up by his birth parents and&nbsp;&nbsp; adopted by a working class couple from mountain&nbsp; view california paul jobs was a salt of the earth&nbsp;&nbsp; guy who was a great mechanic and he taught his&nbsp; son steve how to make great things and he once&nbsp;&nbsp; they were building a fence and he said you got to&nbsp; make the back of the fence that nobody will see&nbsp;&nbsp; just as good looking as the front of&nbsp; the fence even though nobody will see it&nbsp;&nbsp; you will know and that will show that you're&nbsp; dedicated to making something perfect jobs always&nbsp;&nbsp; knew he was adopted but it still had a profound&nbsp; effect on him he told isaacs in this story from&nbsp;&nbsp; his early childhood during one of their many taped&nbsp; interviews i was remember right here on the lawn&nbsp;&nbsp; telling lisa mcmoyler and i lived&nbsp; across the street that i was adopted&nbsp;&nbsp; and she said so does that mean&nbsp; your real parents didn't want you&nbsp;&nbsp; oh lightning bolts i remember running into&nbsp; the house i think i was probably crying&nbsp;&nbsp; asking my parents and they sat me down&nbsp; they said no you don't understand they said&nbsp;&nbsp; we specifically picked you out he said&nbsp; from then on i realized that i was not&nbsp;&nbsp; just abandoned i was chosen i was special and i&nbsp; think that's the key to understanding steve jobs&nbsp;&nbsp; another factor was geography jobs grew up in&nbsp; northern california not far from palo alto&nbsp;&nbsp; he was a gifted child who tested off the charts&nbsp; in a neighborhood populated by engineers you know&nbsp;&nbsp; he was raised in a place that was just learning&nbsp; how to turn silicon into gold it had not yet been&nbsp;&nbsp; named silicon valley but you had the defense&nbsp; industry you had hewlett packard but you also&nbsp;&nbsp; had the counter culture the bay area that entire&nbsp; brew came together in steve jobs he was sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; a hippie-ish rebel kid loved listening to dillon&nbsp; music dropped acid but also he loved electronics&nbsp;&nbsp; jobs would eventually cross paths with a computer&nbsp; wizard at berkeley five years his senior named&nbsp;&nbsp; steve wozniak they became fast friends sharing&nbsp; a love of high-tech pranks and a disdain for&nbsp;&nbsp; authority one of the things they did was to copy&nbsp; and improve an illicit device called the blue box&nbsp;&nbsp; which reproduced the tones that the phone company&nbsp; used and allowed users to make free long distance&nbsp;&nbsp; phone calls wozniak loves the blue box he's doing&nbsp; it as a prank steve says we can sell them we can&nbsp;&nbsp; market them and they sold about a hundred of them&nbsp; and jobs said to me that's the beginning of apple&nbsp;&nbsp; when we started doing that blue box i knew that&nbsp; with wozniak's brilliant designs and my marketing&nbsp;&nbsp; skills we could sell anything that was still a few&nbsp; years off jobs enrolled at reed college in oregon&nbsp;&nbsp; at a time when timothy leary was telling students&nbsp; across the country to turn on tune in and drop&nbsp;&nbsp; out jobs did after one semester the time we&nbsp; grew up in was a magical time it was also very&nbsp;&nbsp; you know spiritual time in my life definitely&nbsp; taking lsd was one of the most important things&nbsp;&nbsp; in my life and not the most important but but&nbsp; right up there he eventually drifted back to&nbsp;&nbsp; his parents house and became one of the first 50&nbsp; employees to work for the video game maker atari&nbsp;&nbsp; but he was not a big hit with his co-workers&nbsp; never wore shoes had very long hair never bathed&nbsp;&nbsp; in fact when he went to work for atari they&nbsp; put him on the night ships because people said&nbsp;&nbsp; he smelled so bad that they didn't want to work&nbsp; with him you know he believed that his vegan diet&nbsp;&nbsp; and the way he lived made it so he didn't have&nbsp; to use deodorant to shower that often it was&nbsp;&nbsp; an incorrect theory as people kept pointing out to&nbsp; him at atari you know he was a pretty abrasive and&nbsp;&nbsp; in some ways you know cantankerous character but&nbsp; these people at atari they kind of get them and&nbsp;&nbsp; they say well we don't want you to leave but how&nbsp; about working the night shift jobs took a leave&nbsp;&nbsp; from atari and spent seven months wandering across&nbsp; india looking for spiritual enlightenment and it&nbsp;&nbsp; turned out not to be a waste of time and when he&nbsp; comes back he says the main thing i've learned&nbsp;&nbsp; is intuition that the people in india are not&nbsp; just pure rational thinkers that the great&nbsp;&nbsp; spiritual ones also have an intuition likewise&nbsp; the simplicity of zen buddhism really informed&nbsp;&nbsp; his design sense that notion that simplicity is&nbsp; the ultimate sophistication when he returned from&nbsp;&nbsp; his trek jobs and wozniak started building and&nbsp; peddling a primitive computer for hobbyists with&nbsp;&nbsp; a thirteen hundred dollar investment they found&nbsp; an apple computer in his parents garage explain&nbsp;&nbsp; to me how somebody who was a hippie a college&nbsp; dropout somebody who drops lsd and marijuana&nbsp;&nbsp; goes off to india and comes back deciding&nbsp; he wants to be a businessman jobs has within&nbsp;&nbsp; him sort of this conflict but he doesn't quite&nbsp; see it as a conflict between being hippie-ish&nbsp;&nbsp; and anti-materialistic but wanting to sell things&nbsp; like wozniak's board wanting to create a business&nbsp;&nbsp; and i think that's exactly what silicon valley&nbsp; was all about in those days let's do a startup in&nbsp;&nbsp; our parents garage and try to create a business&nbsp; so so we don't have to work for somebody else&nbsp;&nbsp; right and steve jobs wasn't all that eager to&nbsp; be an employee at hewlett-packard he was never&nbsp;&nbsp; much of an engineer isaacson said he didn't know&nbsp; how to write code or program a computer that was&nbsp;&nbsp; wozniak's department but jobs understood their&nbsp; importance and their future he was obsessed with&nbsp;&nbsp; making an attractive simple inexpensive computer&nbsp; the apple ii marketed as the first home computer&nbsp;&nbsp; it really didn't do much but tech savvy people&nbsp; snapped them up along with school systems and&nbsp;&nbsp; as he tells isaacson on tape he was soon worth&nbsp; millions of dollars it wasn't very many years&nbsp;&nbsp; before on paper we were worth a lot of money and&nbsp; i was like 25 when you know we were worth maybe&nbsp;&nbsp; 50 million dollars i knew i never had to worry&nbsp; about money again and so i went from not worrying&nbsp;&nbsp; about money because i was pretty poor so not&nbsp; worrying about money because i had a lot of money&nbsp;&nbsp; jobs becomes rich jobs becomes wildly rich makes&nbsp; about a hundred people millionaires when apple&nbsp;&nbsp; goes public one of the things he does though&nbsp; that you know still caused a little ill will&nbsp;&nbsp; there were old friends he used to be&nbsp; with him in the garage his parents garage&nbsp;&nbsp; and they were working at apple but they hadn't&nbsp; quite gotten to the level of chief engineer so&nbsp;&nbsp; they got no stock options wozniak being incredibly&nbsp; generous is giving away his stock options trying&nbsp;&nbsp; to make everybody a millionaire and steve jobs is&nbsp; like very strict on who can get the stock options&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the people who didn't get them was daniel&nbsp; kotke who had been with jobs at reed college&nbsp;&nbsp; in india and in the garage where apple was&nbsp; founded and at one point tries to go to steve&nbsp;&nbsp; and just starts crying but steve can be very cold&nbsp; about these things finally one of the engineers&nbsp;&nbsp; at apple said you know we have to take care&nbsp; of your buddy daniel i'll give him some stock&nbsp;&nbsp; if you match it or whatever and job says yeah&nbsp; i'll match it i'll give 0 you give 0. it was not&nbsp;&nbsp; the only instance of this callous behavior during&nbsp; that time period just before apple went public his&nbsp;&nbsp; longtime girlfriend became pregnant producing&nbsp; a daughter lisa jobs who had himself been born&nbsp;&nbsp; out of wedlock and abandoned denied paternity and&nbsp; refused to pay support until the courts intervened&nbsp;&nbsp; his behavior was typical of a phenomenon that&nbsp; apple employees openly referred to as steve's&nbsp;&nbsp; reality distortion field a term out of star trek&nbsp; the ability to convince himself and others to&nbsp;&nbsp; believe almost anything using his indomitable will&nbsp; and charisma to bend any fact to suit his purpose&nbsp;&nbsp; when he was creating the original macintosh&nbsp; steve jobs would come in and he would say&nbsp;&nbsp; we need to have this done by next month and people&nbsp; say no no you can't actually write this much code&nbsp;&nbsp; by next month and he would say yes you can do it&nbsp; and in the end he would not take no for an answer&nbsp;&nbsp; and he would sort of make the dent in the universe&nbsp; he wanted to he would bend reality and they would&nbsp;&nbsp; accomplish it the reality distortion field it&nbsp; seems like sometimes you use it that that phrase&nbsp;&nbsp; to speak to which you see is sort of a self&nbsp; delusion he could drive himself by magical&nbsp;&nbsp; thinking by believing something that the rest&nbsp; of us couldn't possibly believe and sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp; it worked sometimes it didn't and at the root&nbsp; of this reality distortion theory isaacson says&nbsp;&nbsp; was jobs belief that he was special and chosen&nbsp; and that the rules didn't apply to him he had a&nbsp;&nbsp; great mercedes sports coupe with no license&nbsp; plate on it that was his affectation&nbsp;&nbsp; no license plate he always believed i said why&nbsp; don't you have a license plate one point he said&nbsp;&nbsp; well i don't want people following me i want&nbsp; people and i said well having no license plate&nbsp;&nbsp; is actually more noticeable he said yeah you're&nbsp; probably right you know why i don't have a license&nbsp;&nbsp; plate i said why he said because i don't have&nbsp; a license plate and i think he felt the normal&nbsp;&nbsp; rules just shouldn't apply to him and he had&nbsp; his little everyday acts of rebellion that were&nbsp;&nbsp; showing hey i'm a little bit different parking&nbsp; in handicap spots yeah i mean he always kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of felt i don't succumb to authority so you&nbsp; know that's just who he is that disregard for&nbsp;&nbsp; the establishment helped him achieve some of his&nbsp; biggest successes allowing him to see products and&nbsp;&nbsp; applications that no one else imagined so in 1984&nbsp; apple introduced a truly revolutionary product the&nbsp;&nbsp; macintosh it used graphics icons a mouse and the&nbsp; point-and-click technology that is still standard&nbsp;&nbsp; it was innovative and influential but sales were&nbsp; disappointing and job's confrontational management&nbsp;&nbsp; style became even more brittle he would try&nbsp; and rationalize it in this taped interview&nbsp;&nbsp; with isaacson i feel totally comfortable&nbsp; going in front of everybody else you know&nbsp;&nbsp; god we really [ __ ] up the engineering on this&nbsp; didn't we that's the ante for being in the room&nbsp;&nbsp; so we're brutally honest with each other and&nbsp; all of them can tell me they think i'm full&nbsp;&nbsp; and i can tell anyone i think they're full we've&nbsp; had some rip roaring arguments where we're yelling&nbsp;&nbsp; at each other jobs loved the arguments but not&nbsp; everybody else did and isaacson writes that some&nbsp;&nbsp; of his top people began defecting he was not&nbsp; the world's greatest manager in fact he could&nbsp;&nbsp; have been one of the world's worst managers you&nbsp; know he was always you know upending things and&nbsp;&nbsp; you know throwing things into turmoil this made&nbsp; great products but it didn't make for a great&nbsp;&nbsp; management style jobs would eventually provoke&nbsp; a boardroom showdown with apple president john&nbsp;&nbsp; scully over who should lead the company the board&nbsp; chose scully so he was out of his own company&nbsp;&nbsp; kicked out of his own company and you know&nbsp; he always had that feeling of abandonment&nbsp;&nbsp; there was nothing worse than being abandoned by&nbsp; apple he sold his stock and used the company to&nbsp;&nbsp; start a new venture called next computer which&nbsp; made great products that no one bought but jobs&nbsp;&nbsp; would be saved by a tiny company that he acquired&nbsp; from george lucas for five million dollars&nbsp;&nbsp; pixar studios would eventually revolutionize&nbsp; movie animation and make jobs a multi-billionaire&nbsp;&nbsp; apple hadn't done so well in a decade after&nbsp; jobs left it decided to buy next computer and&nbsp;&nbsp; the services of jobs as a consultant&nbsp; but he would soon take over as ceo&nbsp;&nbsp; and when he goes back it's almost bankrupt it's&nbsp; like 90 days away from bankruptcy they're totally&nbsp;&nbsp; out of money and it's lost its way totally so he&nbsp; says here's a 27 30 things you're making printers&nbsp;&nbsp; or whatever and he draws a chart that just has&nbsp; four squares he says professional home consumer&nbsp;&nbsp; laptop desktop we're going to make four computers&nbsp; he retrenched firing three thousand people and&nbsp;&nbsp; launched a new advertising campaign here's to the&nbsp; crazy ones the misfits the rebels troublemakers&nbsp;&nbsp; steve jobs helped write that himself he edited&nbsp; it he put in they changed the world by the end&nbsp;&nbsp; jobs along with four or five other people have&nbsp; written this not as ad copy but as a manifesto&nbsp;&nbsp; they push the human race forward and while some&nbsp; may see them as the crazy ones we see genius because the people who are crazy enough to think&nbsp; they can change the world are the ones who do&nbsp;&nbsp; the campaign announced what would become&nbsp; the biggest comeback in business history&nbsp;&nbsp; and it did change the world that steve&nbsp; jobs searched for his birth parents&nbsp;&nbsp; and this battle with cancer when 60 minutes&nbsp; returns the story will continue after this when steve jobs returned to apple in 1997 the&nbsp; company had just five percent of the computer&nbsp;&nbsp; market and was almost broke when jobs died of&nbsp; cancer 14 years later apple was the second most&nbsp;&nbsp; valuable corporation in the world just slightly&nbsp; behind exxon mobil in his new biography of jobs&nbsp;&nbsp; walter isaacson writes that he revolutionized or&nbsp; reimagined seven industries personal computers&nbsp;&nbsp; animated movies music telephones tablet computing&nbsp; digital publishing and retail stores he did it&nbsp;&nbsp; isaacson says by standing at the crossroads of&nbsp; science in the humanities connecting creativity&nbsp;&nbsp; with technology and combining leaps of imagination&nbsp; with feats of engineering to produce new devices&nbsp;&nbsp; that consumers hadn't even thought of thank&nbsp; you for coming we're going to make some history&nbsp;&nbsp; together today if you had to pick a day where it&nbsp; all came together january 9 2007 is not a bad one&nbsp;&nbsp; jobs is in san francisco at the mac world&nbsp; conference in full pitch man mode as he&nbsp;&nbsp; unveils his latest product to the faith these&nbsp; are not three separate devices this is one device and we are calling it iphone it is not only&nbsp; a remarkable achievement but a validation&nbsp;&nbsp; of everything that jobs believed in if you made&nbsp; and controlled all of your own hardware and all&nbsp;&nbsp; of your own software you could integrate all of&nbsp; your products and all of your content seamlessly&nbsp;&nbsp; into one digital hub and no one but steve jobs had&nbsp; thought of it this is something microsoft couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; do because it made software but not the hardware&nbsp; it's something sony couldn't do because it made a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of devices but it didn't really make software&nbsp; operating system it's so the only company that had&nbsp;&nbsp; end-to-end control was apple biographer walter&nbsp; isaacson writes that jobs had created a walled&nbsp;&nbsp; garden if you wanted to use any of his products it&nbsp; was easier to buy into the whole apple ecosystem&nbsp;&nbsp; it was something only a complete control freak&nbsp; could have pulled off his personality passions&nbsp;&nbsp; products and private life were all intertwined&nbsp; and closely guarded the more of it that walter&nbsp;&nbsp; isaacson got to see the more he learned what&nbsp; was his house like his house in palo alto is a&nbsp;&nbsp; house on a normal street with a normal sidewalk&nbsp; no big winding driveway no big security fences&nbsp;&nbsp; can drive in the driveway you could walk into the&nbsp; garden in the back gate and open the back door to&nbsp;&nbsp; the kitchen which used to not be locked it was a&nbsp; normal family home and he said i wanted to live in&nbsp;&nbsp; a normal place where the kids could walk the kids&nbsp; could go over to other people's houses and i did&nbsp;&nbsp; not want to live that nut-so lavish lifestyle that&nbsp; so many people do when they get rich there was no&nbsp;&nbsp; live-in help and no entourage he was worth seven&nbsp; billion dollars but not materialistic and he told&nbsp;&nbsp; isaacson in a taped interview that he had learned&nbsp; early on what money could do to people i saw a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of other people at apple and especially&nbsp; after we went public how it changed them&nbsp;&nbsp; and a lot of people thought they had to start&nbsp; being rich so they they would i mean if you&nbsp;&nbsp; went out rolls royces and they bought homes and&nbsp; they and their wives got plastic surgery and they&nbsp;&nbsp; and these i saw these people who are really nice&nbsp; simple people turn into these bizarro people&nbsp;&nbsp; and i made a promise to myself i said i'm not&nbsp; gonna let this money ruin my life do you have&nbsp;&nbsp; a picture of the family oh sure isaacson showed&nbsp; us some personal family pictures that jobs had&nbsp;&nbsp; given him for his book shortly before he died&nbsp; it was a look into a part of job's life that few&nbsp;&nbsp; people would see this is lorraine that's aaron&nbsp; reed eve and this is on their family vacation&nbsp;&nbsp; jobs married laureen powell 20 years ago a former&nbsp; investment banker who could hold her own with her&nbsp;&nbsp; mercurial husband and she's a great balance he&nbsp; knows to pick strong people to be around him&nbsp;&nbsp; and uh she he sure did when he married laureen now&nbsp; this is uh reid for his son reid is very much like&nbsp;&nbsp; his father except for he has his mother's kindness&nbsp; eve is a great horseback rider he i think might&nbsp;&nbsp; someday be in the olympics with horseback riding&nbsp; aaron has a great sense of design he's a really&nbsp;&nbsp; cool kid his fourth child is lisa brennan jobs the&nbsp; daughter jobs had with his girlfriend 33 years ago&nbsp;&nbsp; and neglected for more than a decade until she&nbsp; moved in with the family as a teenager isaacson&nbsp;&nbsp; said their reconciliation was important to jobs&nbsp; because his own birth parents had abandoned him&nbsp;&nbsp; he felt there was a hole he felt something&nbsp; was missing in 1986 he began searching for&nbsp;&nbsp; his biological mother and found joanne scheibel&nbsp; simpson living in los angeles did she know that&nbsp;&nbsp; her son the son that she gave up was steve jobs&nbsp; no but she says to him there's one thing i have&nbsp;&nbsp; to tell you you have a sister and the sister&nbsp; i raised we did not put up for adoption and i&nbsp;&nbsp; must tell her because i've never told this and the&nbsp; sister turns out to be mona simpson the novelist&nbsp;&nbsp; and mona simpson and steve jobs totally bond&nbsp; separated at birth as they say and then they go&nbsp;&nbsp; on a quest a journey to find the birth father&nbsp; especially mona wants to find what she calls&nbsp;&nbsp; the lost father eventually they locate abdulfatah&nbsp; john gendali a syrian american with a phd in&nbsp;&nbsp; political science who is managing a restaurant&nbsp; in sacramento but as jobs tells isaacson on tape&nbsp;&nbsp; he decides to let mota go meet him alone when i&nbsp; was looking for my biological mother obviously&nbsp;&nbsp; you know was looking for my biological father at&nbsp; the same time and i learned a little bit about him&nbsp;&nbsp; and i didn't like what i learned and i asked&nbsp; her to not tell him if we'd ever met and not&nbsp;&nbsp; tell him anything about me so mona goes to the&nbsp; coffee shop meets this guy mr gendali who's&nbsp;&nbsp; running it who says among other things when she&nbsp; asks you know how sorry he is but then he says&nbsp;&nbsp; that he had had another child and mona said&nbsp; what happened to him he said oh i don't know&nbsp;&nbsp; we'll never hear from him again and then he&nbsp; says i wish you could have seen me when i was&nbsp;&nbsp; running a bigger restaurant i used to run one of&nbsp; the best restaurants in silicon valley everybody&nbsp;&nbsp; used to come there even steve jobs used to eat&nbsp; there and mona is sort of taken aback and bites&nbsp;&nbsp; her tongue and doesn't say steve jobs is your son&nbsp; but she looks shocked and he says yeah he was a&nbsp;&nbsp; great tipper and i was in that restaurant once&nbsp; or twice and i remember meeting the owner who was&nbsp;&nbsp; from syria and it was most certainly him and&nbsp; i shook his hand and he shook my hand and&nbsp;&nbsp; that's all and jobs never spoke to him never&nbsp; talked to him never got in touch with him never&nbsp;&nbsp; wanted to see him not even when jobs was on&nbsp; his deathbed the cancer that eventually killed&nbsp;&nbsp; him was discovered accidentally while he was&nbsp; being checked for kidney stones back in 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp; a cat scan showed a shadow on his pancreas that&nbsp; turned out to be a malignant tumor and then they&nbsp;&nbsp; do a biopsy and they're very emotional they say&nbsp; this is good it's one of these very slow growing&nbsp;&nbsp; five percent of pancreatic cancers that&nbsp; can actually be cured but steve jobs&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't get operated on right away he tries&nbsp; to treat it with diet he goes to spiritualists&nbsp;&nbsp; he goes to various ways of of of doing it&nbsp; macrobiotically and he doesn't get an operation&nbsp;&nbsp; why doesn't he get it operated on immediately&nbsp; you know i've asked him that he said i didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; want my body to be open and soon everybody is&nbsp; telling him quit trying to treat it with all&nbsp;&nbsp; these roots and vegetables and things just get&nbsp; operated on but he does it nine months later&nbsp;&nbsp; too late well one assumes it's too late because&nbsp; by the time they operate on them they notice that&nbsp;&nbsp; it has spread to the tissues around the pancreas&nbsp; how could such a smart man do such a stupid thing&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah i think that he kind of felt that if you&nbsp; ignore something if you don't want something&nbsp;&nbsp; to exist you can have magical thinking and&nbsp; it worked for him in the past he regretted&nbsp;&nbsp; you know some of the decisions he made and&nbsp; certainly i think he felt he should have been&nbsp;&nbsp; operated on sooner jobs acknowledged his surgery&nbsp; but soft-pedaled the seriousness of the situation&nbsp;&nbsp; isaacson writes he continued to&nbsp; receive secret cancer treatments&nbsp;&nbsp; even though he was telling everyone he had been&nbsp; cured and that is what people believed until 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp; in 2008 he unveiled the iphone 3 but that wasn't&nbsp; the main story all of a sudden people are gasping&nbsp;&nbsp; because he's lost so much weight he looks&nbsp; so frail and suddenly people are realizing&nbsp;&nbsp; that he's very sick again he denies it publicly he&nbsp; puts out things that there's a hormone imbalance&nbsp;&nbsp; which has a tiny kernel of truth to it because&nbsp; his liver was secreting the wrong hormones but&nbsp;&nbsp; it wasn't just a hormonal imbalance because the&nbsp; cancer had gone to his liver and he's trying to&nbsp;&nbsp; deny it to himself and to the public and this&nbsp; is a problem of course it's a legal problem&nbsp;&nbsp; well it's a publicly traded company and you have a&nbsp; great tension between two principles one of which&nbsp;&nbsp; is you can't withhold material information from&nbsp; shareholders the others has a certain privacy&nbsp;&nbsp; rights of the ceo jobs finally took a medical&nbsp; leave of absence and in march of 2009 received&nbsp;&nbsp; a secret liver transplant in memphis that wasn't&nbsp; publicly acknowledged until three months later&nbsp;&nbsp; the doctors who did the operation could tell&nbsp; that the cancer had spread but jobs returned to&nbsp;&nbsp; work to unveil the ipad and continued working&nbsp; right up until the end what were those last&nbsp;&nbsp; two and a half years of his life like he&nbsp; talked a lot to me about what happened when&nbsp;&nbsp; he got sick and how it focused him he said he&nbsp; no longer wanted to go out no longer to travel&nbsp;&nbsp; the world he would focus on the products he&nbsp; knew the couple of things he wanted to do&nbsp;&nbsp; which was the iphone and then the ipad he had a&nbsp; few other visions i think he would have loved to&nbsp;&nbsp; have conquered television he would love to make an&nbsp; easy to use television set so he had those things&nbsp;&nbsp; but he started focusing on his family again&nbsp; as well and it was a painful brutal struggle&nbsp;&nbsp; and he would talk often to me about the pain&nbsp; in their final meetings jobs would occasionally&nbsp;&nbsp; bring up the subject of death i saw my life as&nbsp; an ark and that it would end and compared to that&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing mattered you know i mean you're&nbsp; born alone you're going to die alone&nbsp;&nbsp; and does anything else really matter i mean what&nbsp; exactly is it that you have to lose steve you know&nbsp;&nbsp; there's nothing he survived nearly eight years&nbsp; with his cancer and in the final meeting with&nbsp;&nbsp; isaacson in mid-august still held out hope that&nbsp; there might be one new drug that could save him&nbsp;&nbsp; he asked me at one point he said there could&nbsp; be things in this book i don't like right&nbsp;&nbsp; and i kind of smiled and said yep you know&nbsp; there'll be probably things you don't like&nbsp;&nbsp; he said that's fine that's fine i won't read it&nbsp; when it comes out i'll read it six months or a&nbsp;&nbsp; year from now did you have any discussions&nbsp; within that day or at any other time about&nbsp;&nbsp; an afterlife i remember sitting in his backyard&nbsp; in his garden one day and he started talking about&nbsp;&nbsp; god he said sometimes i believe in god sometimes&nbsp; i don't i think it's 50 50 maybe but ever since&nbsp;&nbsp; i've had cancer i've been thinking about it&nbsp; more and i find myself believing a bit more&nbsp;&nbsp; i kind of maybe it's because i want to believe in&nbsp; an afterlife that when you die it doesn't just all&nbsp;&nbsp; disappear the wisdom you've accumulated somehow&nbsp; it lives on then he paused for a second he said&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah but sometimes i think it's just like an&nbsp; on off switch click and you're gone he said and&nbsp;&nbsp; paused again he said and that's why i don't&nbsp; like putting on off switches on apple devices"
