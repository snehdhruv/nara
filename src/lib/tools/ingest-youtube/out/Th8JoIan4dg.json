already a bunch of large existing time already a bunch of large existing companies that run background checks but companies that run background checks but companies that run background checks but they weren't well suited for this very they weren't well suited for this very they weren't well suited for this very new use case and that is like exactly new use case and that is like exactly new use case and that is like exactly the kind of change in the world that the kind of change in the world that the kind of change in the world that creates a new opportunity let's talk creates a new opportunity let's talk creates a new opportunity let's talk about proxies about proxies about proxies so a proxy is a large company that does so a proxy is a large company that does so a proxy is a large company that does something similar to your startup but it something similar to your startup but it something similar to your startup but it is not a direct competitor is not a direct competitor is not a direct competitor and so um and so um and so um a good example of this in practice is a a good example of this in practice is a a good example of this in practice is a company called rapid which does food company called rapid which does food company called rapid which does food delivery in Latin America and when delivery in Latin America and when delivery in Latin America and when rapping got started there were already a rapping got started there were already a rapping got started there were already a few delivery companies in other parts of few delivery companies in other parts of few delivery companies in other parts of the world like doordash they're doing the world like doordash they're doing the world like doordash they're doing very well they just hadn't caught on in very well they just hadn't caught on in very well they just hadn't caught on in Latin America yet and so doordash was a Latin America yet and so doordash was a Latin America yet and so doordash was a great proxy to show that this idea of great proxy to show that this idea of great proxy to show that this idea of doing food delivery in Latin America doing food delivery in Latin America doing food delivery in Latin America would probably work is this an idea would probably work is this an idea would probably work is this an idea you'd want to work on for years but this you'd want to work on for

did you should definitely start founders did you should definitely start by looking at ideas in you know the by looking at ideas in you know the by looking at ideas in you know the things that you're experts in things that you're experts in things that you're experts in um it is weird how many startups apply um it is weird how many startups apply um it is weird how many startups apply to YC and we look at their applications to YC and we look at their applications to YC and we look at their applications and the founders like are actually and the founders like are actually and the founders like are actually legitimate experts in something but the legitimate experts in something but the legitimate experts in something but the idea that they're applying with is like idea that they're applying with is like idea that they're applying with is like something completely different something completely different something completely different now if you're if you're a young founder now if you're if you're a young founder now if you're if you're a young founder if you're in college or something you if you're in college or something you if you're in college or something you may not have had a chance to develop may not have had a chance to develop may not have had a chance to develop it's like the level of domain expertise it's like the level of domain expertise it's like the level of domain expertise that the resi founders had so this may that the resi founders had so this may that the resi founders had so this may not be the right recipe for you so let's not be the right recipe for you so let's not be the right recipe for you so let's talk about some other ones talk about some other ones talk about some other ones the next recipe is to start with a the next recipe is to start with a the next recipe is to start with a problem you've personally encountered problem you've personally encountered problem you've personally encountered ideally one that you're in an unusual ideally one that you're in an unusual ideally one that you're in an unusual position to see so vetco is a website position to see so vetco is a website position to see so vetco is a website for veterinarians to order supplies so for veterinarians to order supplies so for veterinarians to order supplies so you can think about it like amazon.com you can think about it like amazon.com you can think about it like amazon.com for vets for vets for vets and the short story of vetcove is that and the short story of vetcove is that and the short story of vetcove is that the founders are brothers the founders are brothers the founders are brothers and their dad is a veterinarian and their dad is a veterinarian and their dad is a veterinarian and growing up they would notice that and growing up they would notice that and growing up they would notice that the way he ordered supplies was like the way he ordered supplies was like the way he ordered supplies was like super old-fashioned like you'd have to super old-fashioned like you'd have to super old-fashioned like you'd have to like call up a supplier on the phone and like call up a supplier on the phone and like call up a supplier on the phone and like order stuff through like a 1-800 like order stuff through like a 1-800 like order stuff through like a 1-800 number or something it was like very number or something it was like very number or something it was like very obvious that you could build an obvious that you could build an obvious that you could build an amazon.com kind of thing that would amazon.com kind of thing that would amazon.com kind of thing that would replace that replace that replace that and I I love the story of vetco because and I I love the story of vetco because and I I love the story of vetco because it's such a great example of what a it's such a great example of what a it's such a great example of what a great startup opportunity looks like great startup opportunity looks like great startup opportunity looks like because thousands of veterinarians must because thousands of veterinarians must because thousands of veterinarians must have known that this was a real problem have known that this was a real problem have known that this was a real problem that it was really annoying there wasn't that it was really annoying there wasn't that it was really annoying there wasn't like a basic website where you could like a basic website where you could like a basic website where you could just go to order supplies but the thing just go to order supplies but the thing just go to order supplies but the thing is veterinarians don't start Tech is veterinarians don't start Tech is veterinarians don't start Tech startups very often and then on the startups very often and then on the startups very often and then on the other hand you had like thousands of other hand you had like thousands of other hand you had like thousands of programmers in Silicon Valley who were programmers in Silicon Valley who were programmers in Silicon Valley who were begging their heads against cisps and begging their heads against cisps and begging their heads against cisps and tarpet ideas totally unaware that over tarpet ideas totally unaware that over tarpet ideas totally unaware that over here there was like a really great here there was like a really great here there was like a really great genuine problem to work on genuine problem to work on genuine problem to work on and because of this when the vet and because of this when the vet and because of this when the vet co-founders got started they had no co-founders got started they had no co-founders got started they had no competition so this amazing idea just competition so this amazing idea just competition so this amazing idea just got left on the table for years so if got left on the table for years so if got left on the table for years so if you want to try to actually use recipes you want to try to actually use recipes you want to try to actually use recipes one and two here's a specific set of one and two here's a specific set of one and two here's a specific set of instructions for how to do it this is instructions for how to do it this is instructions for how to do it this is advice I often give to Founders NYC who advice I often give to Founders NYC who advice I often give to Founders NYC who are pivoting and who are looking for a are pivoting and who are looking for a are pivoting and who are looking for a new idea here's how it works new idea here's how it works new idea here's how it works for each founder on your team for each founder on your team for each founder on your team go through every job you've ever had go through every job you've ever had go through every job you've ever had plus all your internships plus like plus all your internships plus like plus all your internships plus like other life experiences other life experiences other life experiences and think really carefully about each of and think really carefully about each of and think really carefully about each of them them them what problems did you come across what problems did you come across what problems did you come across what did you learn that other people what did you learn that other people what did you learn that other people don't know don't know don't know What are problems or opportunities that What are problems or opportunities that What are problems or opportunities that you've been in kind of a special you've been in kind of a special you've been in kind of a special position to see position to see position to see those are the best places to start those are the best places to start those are the best places to start looking for startup ideas okay the next looking for startup ideas okay the next looking for startup ideas okay the next one is to just think of things you one is to just think of things you one is to just think of things you personally wish existed this is like a personally wish existed this is like a personally wish existed this is like a really classic recipe this is very really classic recipe this is very really classic recipe this is very common advice great example of this is common advice great example of this is common advice great example of this is doordash the short story of doordash is doordash the short story of doordash is doordash the short story of doordash is that the founders of doordash were that the founders of doordash were that the founders of doordash were undergrads at Stanford and the thing undergrads at Stanford and the thing undergrads at Stanford and the thing they really wanted was to be able to they really wanted was to be able to they really wanted was to be able to just order food from local restaurants just order food from local restaurants just order food from local restaurants and have it delivered to their dorm and and have it delivered to their dorm and and have it delivered to their dorm and before doordash you couldn't do that so before doordash you couldn't do that so before doordash you couldn't do that so they started doordash and this is a they started doordash and this is a they started doordash and this is a great recipe but great recipe but great recipe but this is the recipe that is most this is the recipe that is most this is the recipe that is most dangerous and potentially leading to tar dangerous and potentially leading to tar dangerous and potentially leading to tar pit ideas so if you're using this recipe pit ideas so if you're using this recipe pit ideas so if you're using this recipe you just gotta stop and think for a you just gotta stop and think for a you just gotta stop and think for a second is there a reason why this thing second is there a reason why this thing second is there a reason why this thing doesn't exist yet okay the next one is doesn't exist yet okay the next one is doesn't exist yet okay the next one is to look for things in the world that to look for things in the world that to look for things in the world that have changed recently that might have have changed recently that might have have changed recently that might have created a new opportunity a great created a new opportunity a great created a new opportunity a great example of this is covet example of this is covet example of this is covet so when the pandemic started it changed so when the pandemic started it changed so when the pandemic started it changed daily life for all of us and many daily life for all of us and many daily life for all of us and many Founders realize that this created the Founders realize that this created the Founders realize that this created the opportunity for new companies and some opportunity for new companies and some opportunity for new companies and some very successful startups came out of it very successful startups came out of it very successful startups came out of it and and and one of them is this company called one of them is this company called one of them is this company called gather town which builds like this fun gather town which builds like this fun gather town which builds like this fun way to hang out with other people online way to hang out with other people online way to hang out with other people online and the founders of gathered town were and the founders of gathered town were and the founders of gathered town were actually working on a different idea actually working on a different idea actually working on a different idea that wasn't going so well and when the that wasn't going so well and when the that wasn't going so well and when the pandemic started they pivoted to this pandemic started they pivoted to this pandemic started they pivoted to this because it was obvious that like the because it was obvious that like the because it was obvious that like the change in behavior of the pandemic had change in behavior of the pandemic had change in behavior of the pandemic had created a bunch of new opportunities you created a bunch of new opportunities you created a bunch of new opportunities you can also look for companies that have can also look for companies that have can also look for companies that have been successful recently and look for been successful recently and look for been successful recently and look for new variants on them new variants on them new variants on them a good example of this is a company a good example of this is a company a good example of this is a company called Nuvo cargo Nuvo cargo is a good called Nuvo cargo Nuvo cargo is a good called Nuvo cargo Nuvo cargo is a good example of explicitly sitting down to example of explicitly sitting down to example of explicitly sitting down to try to think about startup ideas and try to think about startup ideas and try to think about startup ideas and actually finding a good one which is the actually finding a good one which is the actually finding a good one which is the thing that I told you is hard to do thing that I told you is hard to do thing that I told you is hard to do pneumo cargo is basically flexport for pneumo cargo is basically flexport for pneumo cargo is basically flexport for Latin America they help U.S companies to Latin America they help U.S companies to Latin America they help U.S companies to import stuff from Mexico import stuff from Mexico import stuff from Mexico and the story of nuva cargo is that and the story of nuva cargo is that and the story of nuva cargo is that Deepak the founder was working on a Deepak the founder was working on a Deepak the founder was working on a different idea NYC and he realized that different idea NYC and he realized that different idea NYC and he realized that his idea wasn't going to work his idea wasn't going to work his idea wasn't going to work and he went on like a systematic search and he went on like a systematic search and he went on like a systematic search for better ideas for better ideas for better ideas and he picked Nuvo cargo for for very and he picked Nuvo cargo for for very and he picked Nuvo cargo for for very analytical reasons he picked it because analytical reasons he picked it because analytical reasons he picked it because it was a large Market it was a large Market it was a large Market because they were good because they were good because they were good proxies from other companies flexport proxies from other companies flexport proxies from other companies flexport and he picked it even though he didn't and he picked it even though he didn't and he picked it even though he didn't have deep domain expertise in the import have deep domain expertise in the import have deep domain expertise in the import export space because he had some export space because he had some export space because he had some connections that would enable him to get connections that would enable him to get connections that would enable him to get started and he felt like he would just started and he felt like he would just started and he felt like he would just be very good at running this kind of be very good at running this kind of be very good at running this kind of operationally intensive business operationally intensive business operationally intensive business and that worked really well Niva cargo and that worked really well Niva cargo and that worked really well Niva cargo is doing super well you can also go and is doing super well you can also go and is doing super well you can also go and talk to people and just ask them what talk to people and just ask them what talk to people and just ask them what problems they have this this can work problems they have this this can work problems they have this this can work the the downside with this recipe is it the the downside with this recipe is it the the downside with this recipe is it actually requires a lot of skill if you actually requires a lot of skill if you actually requires a lot of skill if you want to do this I would recommend first want to do this I would recommend first want to do this I would recommend first picking a fertile idea space and then picking a fertile idea space and then picking a fertile idea space and then going and talking to people within that going and talking to people within that going and talking to people within that idea space and I would also recommend idea space and I would also recommend idea space and I would also recommend talking not just to potential customers talking not just to potential customers talking not just to potential customers but also to potent but also to founders but also to potent but also to founders but also to potent but also to founders of companies in that idea space to get of companies in that idea space to get of companies in that idea space to get advice about what ideas are actually advice about what ideas are actually advice about what ideas are actually worth pursuing and a good example of worth pursuing and a good example of worth pursuing and a good example of doing this successfully is a to B and A doing this successfully is a to B and A doing this successfully is a to B and A to B was in the position that a lot of to B was in the position that a lot of to B was in the position that a lot of Founders that struggle to find good Founders that struggle to find good Founders that struggle to find good startup ideas are in which is that the startup ideas are in which is that the startup ideas are in which is that the founders were pretty young and they founders were pretty young and they founders were pretty young and they hadn't acquired a lot of specific domain hadn't acquired a lot of specific domain hadn't acquired a lot of specific domain expertise like the resi founders had yet expertise like the resi founders had yet expertise like the resi founders had yet but they really wanted to do a startup but they really wanted to do a startup but they really wanted to do a startup and they wanted to do a startup that had and they wanted to do a startup that had and they wanted to do a startup that had like a genuinely good idea the way that like a genuinely good idea the way that like a genuinely good idea the way that they came up with the idea for ADB was they came up with the idea for ADB was they came up with the idea for ADB was very systematic and so I'm going to walk very systematic and so I'm going to walk very systematic and so I'm going to walk you through how they did it and really you through how they did it and really you through how they did it and really break it down for you so A to B makes break it down for you so A to B makes break it down for you so A to B makes fuel cards and if you haven't heard of a fuel cards and if you haven't heard of a fuel cards and if you haven't heard of a fuel card it's like a special kind of fuel card it's like a special kind of fuel card it's like a special kind of credit card for truck drivers when the A credit card for truck drivers when the A credit card for truck drivers when the A to B Founders got into YC they pivoted to B Founders got into YC they pivoted to B Founders got into YC they pivoted and they spent the whole YC batch and they spent the whole YC batch and they spent the whole YC batch looking for a new idea and here's how looking for a new idea and here's how looking for a new idea and here's how they did it first they picked an idea they did it first they picked an idea they did it first they picked an idea space and the idea space that they space and the idea space that they space and the idea space that they picked was essentially software for the picked was essentially software for the picked was essentially software for the trucking industry trucking industry trucking industry and they picked this idea space despite and they picked this idea space despite and they picked this idea space despite not being experts at the trucking not being experts at the trucking not being experts at the trucking industry because they felt that it just industry because they felt that it just industry because they felt that it just should be a fertile idea space to go should be a fertile idea space to go should be a fertile idea space to go hunting for startup ideas the trucking hunting for startup ideas the trucking hunting for startup ideas the trucking industry is as like Big Industry hasn't industry is as like Big Industry hasn't industry is as like Big Industry hasn't been that disrupted by startups and been that disrupted by startups and been that disrupted by startups and software yet so they just felt like software yet so they just felt like software yet so they just felt like there were probably some good problems there were probably some good problems there were probably some good problems to work on in the trucking industry but to work on in the trucking industry but to work on in the trucking industry but the problem is the problem is the problem is they didn't know that much about the they didn't know that much about the they didn't know that much about the trucking industry so they didn't know trucking industry so they didn't know trucking industry so they didn't know what those problems were and so they what those problems were and so they what those problems were and so they decided that they would turn themselves decided that they would turn themselves decided that they would turn themselves into experts in the trucking industry into experts in the trucking industry into experts in the trucking industry and what they did is they actually and what they did is they actually and what they did is they actually physically drove two truck stops which physically drove two truck stops which physically drove two truck stops which were places where truck drivers are just were places where truck drivers are just were places where truck drivers are just kind of kind of kind of Milling about and they would just walk Milling about and they would just walk Milling about and they would just walk up to truck drivers and like start up to truck drivers and like start up to truck drivers and like start talking to them and ask them questions talking to them and ask them questions talking to them and ask them questions about what their problems were about what their problems were about what their problems were they also talked to a lot of Founders they also talked to a lot of Founders they also talked to a lot of Founders who had started companies in the who had started companies in the who had started companies in the trucking space to get ideas for what trucking space to get ideas for what trucking space to get ideas for what problems were actually worth working on problems were actually worth working on problems were actually worth working on they would basically talk to like anyone they would basically talk to like anyone they would basically talk to like anyone who knew anything about Trucking that who knew anything about Trucking that who knew anything about Trucking that was willing to talk to them and as they was willing to talk to them and as they was willing to talk to them and as they did that they began to put together like did that they began to put together like did that they began to put together like a mental map of the space and where the a mental map of the space and where the a mental map of the space and where the good ideas were where the bad ideas were good ideas were where the bad ideas were good ideas were where the bad ideas were and they actually went through a whole and they actually went through a whole and they actually went through a whole bunch of different potential ideas bunch of different potential ideas bunch of different potential ideas before eventually deciding to work on before eventually deciding to work on before eventually deciding to work on fuel cards and I love the example of a fuel cards and I love the example of a fuel cards and I love the example of a to B Because A to B is one of the best to B Because A to B is one of the best to B Because A to B is one of the best new ideas to come out of YC in several new ideas to come out of YC in several new ideas to come out of YC in several years A to B is a phenomenal company and years A to B is a phenomenal company and years A to B is a phenomenal company and the approach that they used to find this the approach that they used to find this the approach that they used to find this idea is something that really anyone idea is something that really anyone idea is something that really anyone could do and most Founders don't do this could do and most Founders don't do this could do and most Founders don't do this because it just sounds like too much because it just sounds like too much because it just sounds like too much work so if you're willing to put in the work so if you're willing to put in the work so if you're willing to put in the work this is an amazing way to find a work this is an amazing way to find a work this is an amazing way to find a startup idea okay and my last recipe is startup idea okay and my last recipe is startup idea okay and my last recipe is to just like look for big industries to just like look for big industries to just like look for big industries that seem broken that seem broken that seem broken any Big Industry that seems broken is any Big Industry that seems broken is any Big Industry that seems broken is probably right for disruption and probably right for disruption and probably right for disruption and finally I've got kind of a bonus recipe finally I've got kind of a bonus recipe finally I've got kind of a bonus recipe which is to just find a co-founder that which is to just find a co-founder that which is to just find a co-founder that already has an idea they're actually already has an idea they're actually already has an idea they're actually like a lot of people just on Startup like a lot of people just on Startup like a lot of people just on Startup School co-founder matching right now School co-founder matching right now School co-founder matching right now that already have an idea and are that already have an idea and are that already have an idea and are looking for a co-founder so if you don't looking for a co-founder so if you don't looking for a co-founder so if you don't have a co-founder and you don't have an have a co-founder and you don't have an have a co-founder and you don't have an idea that could be a great hack to idea that could be a great hack to idea that could be a great hack to getting both at the same time the last getting both at the same time the last getting both at the same time the last point that I want to leave you with is point that I want to leave you with is point that I want to leave you with is just to remember that it's often hard to just to remember that it's often hard to just to remember that it's often hard to tell if a startup idea is good or not tell if a startup idea is good or not tell if a startup idea is good or not and so while I hope the concepts that I and so while I hope the concepts that I and so while I hope the concepts that I talked about here will help talked about here will help talked about here will help typically the only way to know for sure typically the only way to know for sure typically the only way to know for sure if your startup idea is good is to Just if your startup idea is good is to Just if your startup idea is good is to Just Launch it and find out so if after all Launch it and find out so if after all Launch it and find out so if after all this you've got a startup idea and this you've got a startup idea and this you've got a startup idea and you're still kind of on the fence about you're still kind of on the fence about you're still kind of on the fence about whether it's actually a good idea or not whether it's actually a good idea or not whether it's actually a good idea or not that is my advice for you just launch it that is my advice for you just launch it that is my advice for you just launch it and find it and find it and find it
