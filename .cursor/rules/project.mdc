</aside>

# Project Summary

AI Audiobook Copilot enhances the audiobook experience by providing real-time information about characters, plot points, or concepts without leaving the listening experience. The app uses advanced AI to understand book content, generate contextual answers, and deliver them in a voice matching the audiobook's narrator.

### AI & Voice

- **Claude 4.1** - Natural language understanding and response generation
- **ElevenLabs** - Voice cloning and text-to-speech synthesis
- **Vapi** - Voice API integration

### Backend & Frontend

- **Convex** - Backend infrastructure and state management
- Next.js

## Key Features

- Overlay interface that works with Spotify and Audible
- Natural language question processing about book content
- Real-time AI-generated answers using Claude 4.1
- Voice response synthesis matching narrator's voice via ElevenLabs
- Minimal context-switching from the audiobook experience

## Project Goals

- [ ]  Build functioning MVP within 20hour hackathon timeframe
- [ ]  Successfully integrate all key technologies (Claude, ElevenLabs, Vapi, Convex, Expo)
- [ ]  Create smooth user experience with minimal latency
- [ ]  Prepare compelling demo showcasing key use cases
- [ ]  Document technical approach and product vision

## Success Metrics

- Working prototype that demonstrates core functionality
- Response accuracy for questions about book content
- Voice synthesis quality and narrator matching
- Latency between question asked and answer delivered
- Judge and audience feedback during presentation
