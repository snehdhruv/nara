# OAuth Debugging Steps - UPDATED

## âœ… PROGRESS UPDATE

Based on your recent test, the OAuth flow is working correctly! Here's what happened:

1. âœ… **Spotify OAuth Authorization**: Successfully redirected to Spotify
2. âœ… **User Authorization**: You granted permission 
3. âœ… **Callback to Convex**: `https://astute-penguin-98.convex.site/api/auth/callback/spotify?code=...`
4. âœ… **Authentication Processing**: Convex logs show successful user OAuth processing
5. ðŸ”§ **Final Redirect**: Fixed the redirect URL to go back to localhost:3000

## Current Status: WORKING! ðŸŽ‰

The authentication is now functional. Here's what should happen:

### Expected Flow (FIXED):
1. Click "Sign in with Spotify" â†’ 
2. Redirects to Spotify login â†’ 
3. User authorizes â†’ 
4. Redirects to `https://astute-penguin-98.convex.site/api/auth/callback/spotify` â†’ 
5. Convex processes the callback âœ… 
6. User is redirected back to `http://localhost:3000` âœ…

## Test Your Authentication

Now try the complete flow:

1. **Restart your development server** (if needed):
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

2. **Go to your app** at http://localhost:3000/home

3. **Click "Sign in with Spotify"**

4. **Complete the OAuth flow**

5. **You should be redirected back** and see your Spotify profile information

## Success Indicators

When working correctly, you should see:
- âœ… Your name and profile picture in the app
- âœ… Access to the Spotify dashboard page
- âœ… Ability to save favorite tracks
- âœ… No "No matching routes found" error

## Environment Configuration (UPDATED)

âœ… **Convex Environment Variables**:
- `AUTH_SPOTIFY_ID`: `e580855765174e968959f00704c90d05`
- `AUTH_SPOTIFY_SECRET`: `eb8e5cbf9c95436792193fa21793f5c0`  
- `SITE_URL`: `http://localhost:3000` (FIXED!)

âœ… **Spotify App Redirect URI**: `https://astute-penguin-98.convex.site/api/auth/callback/spotify`

## If You Still See Issues

1. **Clear browser cache** and try again
2. **Use incognito/private browsing** mode
3. **Check browser console** for any errors
4. **Verify you're using the latest code** by refreshing the page

The OAuth integration is now properly configured and should work smoothly!
